# Arrowfy

**UPDATE July 21, 2018:** [Sketch v51](https://blog.sketchapp.com/styles-in-libraries-and-fixed-elements-in-prototyping-in-sketch-51-aab4074c3f46) FINALLY fixes the truly awful default arrows that used to come with sketch! Future work on this plugin will likely cease given that there's now a built-in decent arrowhead that will only get better with each later release.

-----------------

This plugin adds simple solid arrowheads to any line, sized and colored to match path style.

## Installation
Double-click on .sketchplugin file.

## Usage
Select one or multiple paths, then hit Ctrl-Shift-A to add auto-styled
arrowheads to end. Menu allows adding arrowhead to beginning or both ends
of paths instead.
